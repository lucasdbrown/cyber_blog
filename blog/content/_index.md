Welcome to my cybersecurity blog! I'm Lucas Brown, a Junior at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) studying Cybersecurity.

## About Me

I'm passionate about understanding the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats and developing effective defense strategies. My areas of expertise include:

- **Malware Analysis**: Reverse engineering malicious software to understand attack vectors and develop countermeasures
- **APT Campaigns**: Studying Advanced Persistent Threat groups and their sophisticated attack methodologies  
- **OT Security**: Protecting Operational Technology and Industrial Control Systems from cyber threats
- **Threat Intelligence**: Analyzing threat actors and their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)

Through this blog, I share my research, analysis, and insights into the cybersecurity world. Whether it's breaking down a new malware sample, analyzing an APT campaign, or exploring OT security challenges, I aim to contribute to the cybersecurity community and help others learn about these critical topics.
