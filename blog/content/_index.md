Welcome to my cybersecurity blog! I'm Lucas Brown, a Junior at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) studying Cybersecurity.

## About Me

I'm passionate about understanding the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats, from headline-grabbing campaigns to the subtle tradecraft of advanced threat actors. I enjoy digging into malware samples, dissecting the techniques behind APT operations, and exploring what they reveal about the broader threat landscape.

A big part of my focus is OT security—how we defend critical infrastructure like power grids, water plants, and manufacturing systems. I’ve built simulations and digital twins to model these environments, giving me hands-on ways to study protocols, industrial control systems (ICS), and the kinds of attacks that have shaped industrial security and cybersecurity in general.

Through this blog, I share my research, analysis, and interests in the cybersecurity world. Whether it's breaking down a new malware sample, analyzing an APT campaign, or exploring current events, I aim to contribute to the cybersecurity community and help others learn about cybersecurity.
